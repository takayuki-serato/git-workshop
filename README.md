Hello World!

The quick brown fox and cat
jumped over the
lazy frog

Then the lazy dog
ate my homework

Then my teacher ate the dog.

The end

Or is it???

The next day the teacher rose from the dead

But dogs aren't lazy so this story is fully cooked

The sly red cat
slipped beneath the
dozing hound
